Python - Async refers to the use of asynchronous programming in Python, particularly with the use of the asyncio module. Asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking execution of tasks, which can improve the performance and efficiency of programs that have to deal with tasks that may take a variable amount of time to complete. By using asynchronous programming, Python programs can perform multiple tasks concurrently, making it easier to work with I/O-bound operations such as network requests or file operations.
